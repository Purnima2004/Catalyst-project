**Curated Learning Resources (from knowledge base):**
{resources_text}

**Adjacent Skills from Knowledge Graph to Consider:**

Generate the full learning plan now. For each skill gap:
1. Set a clear weekly goal.
2. Reference the curated resources above (with links).
3. Suggest a hands-on project to apply the learning.
4. Give a realistic total time estimate.

End the plan with a "Strengths to Leverage" section.
